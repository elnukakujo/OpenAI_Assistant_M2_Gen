Sure! Here is an example of a simple MetaModel written in Xtext syntax for a company entity with employees and products:

```java
grammar org.example.company.CompanyDSL with org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate companyDSL "http://www.example.org/company/CompanyDSL"

Company:
    'company' name=ID
    'employees' employees+=Employee*
    'products' products+=Product*
;

Employee:
    'employee' name=ID
;

Product:
    'product' name=ID
;
```

This MetaModel consists of three main entities - `Company`, `Employee`, and `Product`. The `Company` entity has a name attribute, a list of employees, and a list of products. The `Employee` entity has a name attribute, and the `Product` entity also has a name attribute.

You can further extend this MetaModel by adding more attributes and relationships between entities as needed.
