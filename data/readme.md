This is the supplmentary matrial for the paper: Automated Domain Modeling with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study

- The file: __Modeling__ contains doamin examples and their reference domain models.
- The folder: __llm-model-generation-master__ contains scripts for running large langugae models and post-processing the results. This folder contains another readme.md file and requirement.txt file for executing the scripts.
- The folder: __Problem Descriptions__ contains textual domain descriptions along with their graphical solutions.
- The folder: __Data analysis__ contains scripts for analyzing the experiment results. Note: the notebooks in this folder are developed and executed on Colaboratory platform. 
- The folder: __experiments_result__ contains the results of each run on LLMs
- The folder: __Round 1 Evaluation__ contains evalution of the generated domain models for the first round.
- The folder: __Round 2 Evaluation__ contains evalution of the generated domain models for the second round.
