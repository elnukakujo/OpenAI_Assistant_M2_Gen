Description: A city is using the Bus Transportation Management System (BTMS) to simplify the day-to-day activities related to the city’s public bus system.

The BTMS keeps track of a driver’s name and automatically assigns a unique ID to each driver. A bus route is identified by a unique number that is determined by city staff, while a bus is identified by its unique licence plate. The highest possible number for a bus route is 9999, while a licence plate number may be up to 10 characters long, inclusive. For up to a year in advance, city staff assigns buses to routes. Several buses may be assigned to a route per day. Each bus serves at the most one route per day but may be assigned to different routes on different days. Similarly, for up to a year in advance, city staff posts the schedule for its bus drivers. For each route, there is a morning shift, an afternoon shift, and a night shift. A driver is assigned by city staff to a shift for a particular bus on a particular day. The BTMS offers city staff great flexibility, i.e., there are no restrictions in terms of how many shifts a bus driver has per day. It is even possible to assign a bus driver to two shifts at the same time.

The current version of BTMS does not support the information of bus drivers or buses to be updated – only adding and deleting is supported. However, BTMS does support indicating whether a bus driver is on sick leave and whether a bus is in the repair shop. If that is the case, the driver cannot be scheduled or the bus cannot be assigned to a route. For a given day, an overview shows – for each route number – the licence plate number of each assigned bus, the entered shifts and the IDs and names of the assigned drivers. If a driver is currently sick or a bus is in the repair shop, the driver or bus, respectively, is highlighted in the overview.

Description: The Helping Hand Store (H2S) collects second hand articles and non-perishable foods from residents. A resident enters a name, street address, phone number, optional email address, as well as a description of the items to be picked up. 

At the beginning of every weekday, a pickup route for that day is determined for each vehicle for which a volunteer driver is available. Volunteer drivers indicate their available days on the H2S website. The route takes into account the available storage space of a vehicle and the dimensions and weights of scheduled items. After completing all scheduled pickups, the driver drops off all collected second hand articles at H2S’s distribution center. Those articles that can still be used are tagged with an RFID device. In addition, the H2S employee assigns a category to the article from a standard list of 134 categories (e.g., baby clothing, women’s winter boots, fridge, microwave…). 

H2S allows those clients to indicate which categories of articles they need. An H2S employee calls them to let them know about the relevant articles that were dropped off that day. Delivery of such articles is made by a volunteer driver before picking up items according to the pickup route.

Description: The LabTracker software helps (i) doctors manage the requisition of tests and examinations for patients and (ii) patients book appointments for tests and examinations at a lab. For the remainder of this description, tests and examinations are used interchangeably. 

For a requisition, a doctor must provide their numeric practitioner number and signature for verification as well as their full name, their address, and their phone number. The signature is a digital signature, i.e., an image of the actual signature of the doctor. Furthermore, the doctor indicates the date from which the requisition is valid. The requisition must also show the patient’s information including their alpha-numeric health number, first name and last name, date of birth, address, and phone number. A doctor cannot prescribe a test for themselves but can prescribe tests to someone else who is a doctor. 

Several tests can be combined on one requisition but only if they belong to the same group of tests. For example, only blood tests can be combined on one requisition or only ultrasound examinations can be combined. It is not possible to have a blood test and an ultrasound examination on the same requisition. For each test, its duration is defined by the lab network, so that it is possible to schedule appointments accordingly. The duration of a test is the same at each lab. For some kinds of tests, it does not matter how many tests are performed. They take as long as a single test. For example, several blood tests can be performed on a blood sample, i.e., it takes as long to draw the blood sample for a single blood test as it does for several blood tests. 

A doctor may also indicate that the tests on a requisition are to be repeated for a specified number of times and interval. The interval is either weekly, monthly, every half year, or yearly. All tests on a requisition are following the same repetition pattern. 

The doctor and the patient can view the results of each test (either negative or positive) as well as the accompanying report. 

A patient is required to make an appointment for some tests while others are walk-in only. For example, x-ray examinations require an appointment, but blood tests are walk-in only (i.e., it is not possible to make an appointment for a blood test). On the other hand, some tests only require a sample to be dropped off (e.g., a urine or stool sample). 

To make an appointment for a requisition, a patient selects the desired lab based on the lab’s address and business hours. For requisitions with repeated tests, a patient is only allowed to make one appointment at a time. The confirmation for an appointment also shows a confirmation number, the date as well as start/end times, and the name of the lab as well as its registration number. It is possible to change or cancel an appointment at any time but doing so within 24 hours of the appointment incurs a change/cancellation fee. Each lab determines its own fee and business hours. All labs are open every day of the year and offer all tests. The business hours of a lab do not change from one week to the next. Each day a lab is open from the day’s start time to its end time, i.e., there are no breaks.
